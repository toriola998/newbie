        note: `Research has shown that over 70% of web traffic is generated by mobile devices, so it only makes
         sense for software developers to develop mobile applications specifically for these devices. And that is 
         exactly what Mobile development is. Mobile development is simply the branch of software development that deals 
         with developing software for mobile devices like smart phones or tablets.

        \n\nAs it stands now, the fact remains that research shows that adults spend an average of 3+ hours on their mobile devices 
        daily browsing the web. This is why mobile applications are considered the future of businesses all around the world. 
        The most popular e-commerce platforms like Amazon have already started making use of mobile applications for their 
        business development. 
        
        \n\nMobile development often involves a series of design and 
        programming processes aimed at creating the best application from scratch in the shortest possible time.`
